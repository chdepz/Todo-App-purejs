# Simple Todo List Web App with Local Storage

This repository contains a basic todo list web application implemented in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The application allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, which are stored in the browser's local storage for persistence across sessions.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Users can add new tasks to the list by entering task descriptions and clicking the "Add" button.

- **Edit Task**: Tasks can be edited by clicking the "Edit" button next to each task, which allows users to modify the task description. Clicking "Save" will update the task.

- **Delete Task**: Tasks can be deleted by clicking the "Delete" button next to each task.

- **Local Storage**: The app uses local storage to store the tasks, ensuring that tasks are retained even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

## How It Works

- The application initializes by rendering the existing tasks from local storage when the page loads.

- Users can add tasks by entering text in the input field and clicking "Add."

- Tasks are displayed in a list format, and each task has options to edit or delete it.

- Clicking "Edit" on a task enables editing mode for that task, and clicking "Save" saves the changes.

- Clicking "Delete" removes the task from the list.

## Usage

Clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start using the todo list application. No additional setup is required.
